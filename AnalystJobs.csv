The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to our mission of saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries. We work at the invitation of governments to support them and the private sector to create and sustain high-quality health systems.

CHAI was founded in 2002 in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic with the goal of dramatically reducing the price of life-saving drugs and increasing access to these medicines in the countries with the highest burden of the disease. Over the following two decades, CHAI has expanded its focus. Today, along with HIV, we work in conjunction with our partners to prevent and treat infectious diseases such as COVID-19, malaria, tuberculosis, and hepatitis. Our work has also expanded into cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and other non-communicable diseases, and we work to accelerate the rollout of lifesaving vaccines, reduce maternal and child mortality, combat chronic malnutrition, and increase access to assistive technology. We are investing in horizontal approaches to strengthen health systems through programs in human resources for health, digital health, and health financing. With each new and innovative program, our strategy is grounded in maximizing sustainable impact at scale, ensuring that governments lead the solutions, that programs are designed to scale nationally, and learnings are shared globally.

At CHAI, our people are our greatest asset, and none of this work would be possible without their talent, time, dedication and passion for our mission and values. We are a highly diverse team of enthusiastic individuals across 40 countries with a broad range of skillsets and life experiences. CHAI is deeply grounded in the countries we work in, with majority of our staff based in program countries.

In India, CHAI works in partnership with its India registered affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF) under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States' levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently, WJCF supports government partners across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, tuberculosis, COVID-19, common cancers, sexual and reproductive health, immunization, and essential medicines.

Project Overview

According to the World Health Organization’s Global TB report 2022, an estimated 10.6 million people fell ill with tuberculosis (TB) in 2021, an increase of 4.5% from 2020, and 1.6 million people died from TB. The burden of drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) also increased by 3% between 2020 and 2021 with 450 000 new cases of rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) in 2021. This is the first time in many years that an increase has been reported in the number of people falling ill with TB and drug resistant TB.

WJCF works in 15 states and with the Central TB Division (CTD) to implement novel interventions to catalyze the elimination targets outlined in the National TB Elimination Program (NTEP). It also lends technical support to Governments across a range of thematic areas- strategic planning, data analytics, monitoring and evaluation, patient management and delivery of services. WJCF has been supporting CTD and Governments of Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh in improving the quality of TB care, especially to private sector patients, by enhancing their access to the latest diagnostic tools, free fixed dose combination (FDC) regimens made available by the Government, and monetary income support benefits under the Nikshay Poshan Yojana.

It is an e-voucher developed for person-specific and purpose-specific payments. eRUPI is a minimal logistics, leak-proof delivery mechanism for a wide range of government Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) programs. The digital e-voucher platform can also be used by organizations that wish to support welfare services through eRUPI instead of cash.

A feasibility pilot study has been designed to understand the programmatic, technological and financial aspects of a potential e-RUPI scale-up. The study is planned to be implemented in Varanasi and Mumbai and will involve the disbursement of eRUPI vouchers for chest x-rays for individuals with presumptive TB.

Role Overview

We’re inspired to work with healthcare leaders on our founding vision and unlock world-class medicine through world-class operations.

We believe that diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are fundamental to improving healthcare and society, and that’s why we’re building a company that leads the way. We hold ourselves accountable for using fair hiring processes that mitigate the negative impacts of unconscious bias.

 Sustainability 

At AXA XL, Sustainability is integral to our business strategy. In an ever-changing world, AXA XL protects what matters most for our clients and communities. We know that sustainability is at the root of a more resilient future. Our 2023-26 Sustainability strategy, called “Roots of resilience”, focuses on protecting natural ecosystems, addressing climate change, and embedding sustainable practices across our operations.

Our Pillars

 Valuing nature: How we impact nature affects how nature impacts us. Resilient ecosystems - the foundation of a sustainable planet and society – are essential to our future. We’re committed to protecting and restoring nature – from mangrove forests to the bees in our backyard – by increasing biodiversity awareness and inspiring clients and colleagues to put nature at the heart of their plans. 
 Addressing climate change: The effects of a changing climate are far-reaching and significant. Unpredictable weather, increasing temperatures, and rising sea levels cause both social inequalities and environmental disruption. We're building a net zero strategy, developing insurance products and services, and mobilizing to advance thought leadership and investment in societal-led solutions. 
 Integrating ESG: All companies have a role to play in building a more resilient future. Incorporating ESG considerations into our internal processes and practices builds resilience from the roots of our business. We’re training our colleagues, engaging our external partners, and evolving our sustainability governance and reporting. 
 AXA Hearts in Action : We have established volunteering and charitable giving programs to help colleagues support causes that matter most to them, known as AXA XL’s “Hearts in Action” programs. These include our Matching Gifts program, Volunteering Leave, and our annual volunteering day – the Global Day of Giving.

Workday is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace.

Our Approach to Flexible Work

With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
